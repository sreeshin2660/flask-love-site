      This is not just a website. It's a little digital galaxy â€” built from code, time, and love â€” just for us. A place to hold what words cannot always say.

        <h2>ðŸ’– For Migga</h2>
        <p>Every click, every color, every line of code â€” it's all for you. You inspire me. This is a gift to say how much you mean to me, beyond words.</p>
